**Q: thats so cool how did you made it?**

**In general:** I used the normal basics of making a website and mixed with my coding abilities with some researches. 

**the forums page**: i used linked github discussions with the site's div through the extention called giscus (its very easy to set it up).

**the domain**: i used a site called https://www.freenom.com and configured the dns with github. Thats how i got my domain running on gg-pages. 

That is how i run my site for now.

That is also how you can make yours. Good luck on making your own website.
